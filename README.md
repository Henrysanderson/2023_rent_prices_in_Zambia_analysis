# 2023_rent_prices_in_Zambia_analysis
The analysis of the Lusaka rent prices dataset explores key factors that influence rental costs, such as location, property size, and the number of amenities like bedrooms and bathrooms. Starting with data cleaning, missing values in the dataset were either filled or dropped based on their significance, ensuring the data’s reliability. Statistical questions were addressed to uncover patterns—for example, examining average rent per area, the relationship between rent and house size, and the impact of the number of bedrooms or bathrooms on rental cost.

Several visualizations were created to highlight insights:
1. **Rent by Area**: A bar graph compared average rents across different Lusaka areas.
2. **Rent vs. Property Size**: A scatter plot illustrated the relationship between property size and rent, highlighting trends.
3. **Distribution of Amenities**: Histograms and pie charts displayed the distribution of bedrooms, bathrooms, and garages.
4. **Dynamic Rent Distribution by Area**: An interactive element was added where users select an area to view a tailored rent distribution histogram, offering a closer look at area-specific rent variability.

This analysis provides a comprehensive view of Lusaka’s rental market, helping users visualize and understand the factors affecting rental prices. Each visualization is designed for easy interaction and exploration, making it valuable for potential renters, investors, and analysts alike.
